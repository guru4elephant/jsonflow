{"id": "sample-1", "prompt": "Explain the concept of JSON streaming in data processing pipelines.", "metadata": {"category": "technical", "max_tokens": 200}, "response": "# JSON Streaming in Data Processing Pipelines\n\nJSON streaming refers to the technique of processing JSON data incrementally, one record at a time, rather than loading the entire dataset into memory. This approach is particularly valuable in data processing pipelines for several reasons:\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- **Record-by-record processing**: Data is handled sequentially as it arrives\n- **Memory efficiency**: Only current records are kept in memory\n- **Low latency**: Processing begins before all data is available\n- **Scalability**: Can handle datasets larger than available RAM\n\n## Common Implementation Methods\n\n1. **Line-delimited JSON**: Each line contains a complete, self-contained JSON object\n2. **JSON arrays with iterative parsing**: Processing array elements one at a time\n3. **Specialized streaming parsers**: Libraries like JSONL, Jackson (Java), or ijson (Python)\n\n## Benefits in Data Pipelines\n\n- Enables real-time data processing and analytics\n- Reduces system resource requirements\n- Supports processing of unbounded data streams\n- Improves throughput for large-scale data operations\n\nJSON streaming is particularly valuable when working with large datasets, real-time data feeds, or in resource-constrained environments."}
