{"id": 2, "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?", "metadata": {"type": "philosophy", "length": "medium"}, "response": "The meaning of life is a profound philosophical question that has different answers depending on one's perspective. There's no single universally agreed-upon answer. Some find meaning in relationships, personal growth, contributing to society, spiritual beliefs, pursuing happiness, or creating their own purpose. What gives your life meaning is ultimately a personal journey of discovery."}

{"id": 4, "prompt": "Explain quantum physics", "metadata": {"type": "science", "length": "long"}, "response": "# Quantum Physics Overview\n\nQuantum physics is the branch of physics that describes how matter and energy behave at the smallest scales. Key concepts include:\n\n- **Wave-particle duality**: Objects can behave as both particles and waves\n- **Uncertainty principle**: Cannot precisely know both position and momentum simultaneously\n- **Quantum superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states until measured\n- **Quantum entanglement**: Particles can become connected, with states remaining correlated regardless of distance\n- **Quantization**: Energy, angular momentum and other quantities come in discrete amounts\n\nQuantum physics underlies modern technology like computers, lasers, and MRI machines, while challenging our intuitive understanding of reality with phenomena that appear strange compared to everyday experience."}
